One of our science and engineering mentors left comments on your childâ€™s project! Your child can log on to Curiosity Machine(link) as {{ student.first_name or student.user.username}} to review the feedback and respond to the mentor.

Then, you can help your child incorporate the mentor feedback as s/he continue to redesign the project!
